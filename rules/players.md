# Player Rules
Quantifiable concerns like min-maxing and metagaming should peaceably coexist with qualitative concerns like player agency and narrative.
Given that these interests are often juxtaposed against eachother, some guidelines should be put in place to enable a good balance between the two.

Ideally, individual characters should be capable in unique ways and be not much more powerful than each other. Players should be forced to rely upon eachothers strengths and fill in for eachothers weaknesses.

Ideally, combat should be fast and loose, enabling both strategic and narrative elements.

## Character Creation

### Rulings

#### Stats
Stats are determined by standard array:
```
15 14 13 12 10 8
```

#### Source Books

Race, Class, Subclass, and Background attributes may be sourced from only the original 3 core D&D 5E rulebooks:
* The Player's Handbook (PHB)
* The Dungeon Master's Guide (DMG)
* The Monster Manual (MM)

### Adjusted Feats

#### Lucky
The lucky feat is too powerful and isn't narratively interesting.
It is banned.

#### Sentinel
The sentinel feat is too powerful and doesn't make sense narratively.
It is rebalanced to respect creature size & speed as follows:
```
You have mastered techniques to take advantage of every drop in any enemy's guard, gaining the following benefits.
  When you hit a creature with an opportunity attack, if the creature is no more than one size greater than you, the creature's speed is reduced by 30ft for the rest of the turn.
  Creatures provoke opportunity attacks from you even if they take the Disengage action before leaving your reach.
  When a creature within 5 feet of you makes an attack against a target other than you (and that target doesn't have this feat), you can use your reaction to make a melee weapon attack against the attacking creature.
```

### Suggestions

#### Reflavor Abilities
If players want a kind of ability or character which is not represented by the options, they should take an existing option and re-flavor it as something else.

For example, a Warlock's Eldritch Blast spell could be re-flavored to appear firey if their patron is a fiend.
Or, a Druid's Tidal Wave spell could be re-flavored as a stampede of animals.
Or, a Barbarian's Rage could be re-flavored as a magical effect which causes them to shapeshift into another humanoid creature.

## Combat

### Mechanics

#### Diagonal Movement & Range
On a square grid, every other diagonal movement (or range calculation) costs 5ft instead of 10ft.
The first diagonal costs 5ft, the second costs 10ft, the third costs 5ft, the fourth costs 10ft, etc.

#### Advantage & Disadvantage Stacking
Advantage & disadvantage cancel only one occurance of eachother, rather than all instances of eachother.
Furthermore, additional advantage after the first stacks as a +2 to your roll, and additonal disadvantage after the first stacks as a -2 to your roll.

For example, if a creature has 3 sources of advantage, and 1 source of disadvantage, they will treat it as if they have 2 sources of advantage.
Because the player has 2 advantage, they would roll 2d20+2.
If a player had 4 advantage, they would roll 2d20+6.

#### Massive Critical Damage
When a creature rolls a critical hit on an attack roll, they roll twice as many damage dice and choose one dice to automatically make the max value.

#### Targeted Attacks
A creature may target an item or body part on their enemy. If they do so, they have disadvantage to hit and the AC may be higher, but if they hit, they could cause an additional bonus effect depending upon what they target and how much damage they deal.

#### Bonus Action Potions
A creature may drink a potion as a bonus action, however they provoke opportunity attacks if they do.

#### Prone Changes
Falling down during combat should be really bad!
The prone condition is made more deadly as follows:
```
A prone creature is subject to the following.
  To stand up while prone costs 15ft of movement and provokes opportunity attacks.
  The creature may crawl (movement costs double).
  The creature has disadvantage on attack rolls.
  An attack roll against the creature has advantage if the attacker is within 5ft of the creature. Otherwise, the attack roll has disadvantage.
```

#### Damage Indication
Players and the DM should communicate about health in qualitative terms to prevent metagaming.
* A creature is "bloodied" when at half health.
* A creature is "mortally wounded" when at one-quarter health.

### Speed Rules

#### "Hold My Turn!"
At the start of a player's turn, they may decide to hold their turn until the next creature's turn is finished. This permanently modifies the initiative order.

#### Turn Timer
If a player does not decide what they'll do for their turn within 10-15 seconds, they hold their turn while the next creature in initiative order goes.

#### Fast Attack Rolls
Damage dice must be rolled with your attack roll, or the roll to hit doesn't count.
If you roll a [critical hit](#massive-critical-damage):
* First count the damage total you already rolled.
* Second, set aside your max damage die.
* Third, reroll the rest of the dice.
* Finally, add the previous damage total to the dice to calculate your new total.
